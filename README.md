## SPIN: Sex-specific and Pathway-based Interpretable Neural Network for Sexual Dimorphism Analysis

Sex differences in prevalence, severity, and genetic susceptibility exist for most common diseases. Most clinical outcomes and genetic data analyses are designed in sex-combined framework considering sex as a covariate, and only few studies analyze males and females separately, which fail to identify gene-by-sex interaction. Here, we propose a novel unified interpretable DL-based framework (SPIN) for sexual dimorphism analysis. SPIN identifies sex-specific and -shared risk loci that are often missed in sex-combined/-separate analysis. We also demonstrate that SPIN is interpretable for explaining how biological pathways contribute to sexual dimorphism and improve risk prediction, contributing to precision medicine initiatives.
